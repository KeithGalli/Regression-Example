As a Data Scientist at a top Health Insurance company, you have the opportunity to predict customer healthcare costs using the power of machine learning. Your insights will help tailor services and guide customers in planning their healthcare expenses more effectively.\n\n## Dataset Summary\n\nMeet your primary tool: the `insurance.csv` dataset. Packed with information on health insurance customers, this dataset is your key to unlocking patterns in healthcare costs. Here's what you need to know about the data you'll be working with:\n\n## insurance.csv\n| Column    | Data Type | Description                                                      |\n|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `age`       | int       | Age of the primary beneficiary.                                  |\n| `sex`       | object    | Gender of the insurance contractor (male or female).             |\n| `bmi`       | float     | Body mass index, a key indicator of body fat based on height and weight. |\n| `children`  | int       | Number of dependents covered by the insurance plan.              |\n| `smoker`    | object    | Indicates whether the beneficiary smokes (yes or no).            |\n| `region`    | object    | The beneficiary's residential area in the US, divided into four regions. |\n| `charges`   | float     | Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.             |\n\n\n\nA bit of data cleaning is key to ensure the dataset is ready for modeling. Once your model is built using the `insurance.csv` dataset, the next step is to apply it to the `validation_dataset.csv`. This new dataset, similar to your training data minus the `charges` column, tests your model's accuracy and real-world utility by predicting costs for new customers.\n\n## Let's Get Started!\n\nThis project is your playground for applying data science in a meaningful way, offering insights that have real-world applications. Ready to explore the data and uncover insights that could revolutionize healthcare planning?
